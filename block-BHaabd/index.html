          Cats are one of, if not the most, popular pet in the world. There are
          over 500 million domestic cats in the world. Cats and humans have been
          associated for nearly 10000 years. Cats conserve energy by sleeping
          for an average of 13 to14 hours a day. Cats have flexible bodies and
          teeth adapted for hunting small animals such as mice and rats. A group
          of cats is called a clowder, a male cat is called a tom, a female cat
          is called a molly or queen while young cats are called kittens.
          Domestic cats usually weigh around 4 kilograms (8 lb 13 oz) to 5
          kilograms (11 lb 0 oz). The heaviest domestic cat on record is 21.297
          kilograms (46 lb 15.2 oz). Cats can be lethal hunters and very sneaky,
          when they walk their back paws step almost exactly in the same place
          as the front paws did beforehand, this keeps noise to a minimum and
          limits visible tracks. Cats have powerful night vision, allowing them
          to see at light levels six times lower than what a human needs in
          order to see. Cats also have excellent hearing and a powerful sense of
          smell. Older cats can at times act aggressively towards kittens

          Domestic cats love to play, this is especially true with kittens who
          love to chase toys and play fight. Play fighting among kittens may be
          a way for them to practice and learn skills for hunting and fighting.
          On average cats live for around 12 to 15 years.
